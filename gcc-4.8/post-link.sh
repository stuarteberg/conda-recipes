## TEST: Here we verify that gcc can build a simple "Hello world" program for both C and C++.
##
## Note: This tests the gcc package's ability to actually function as a compiler.
##       Therefore, packages should never depend on the gcc package as a 'run' dependency, 
##       i.e. just for its packaged libraries (they should depend on 'libgcc' instead).
##       That way, if there are systems which can't use this gcc package for its
##       compiler (due to portability issues) can still use packages produced with it.
